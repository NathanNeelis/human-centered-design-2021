## :sparkles: Exclusive design
Exclusive design is designing for the needs of a specific person. This person may have or may not have a disability to take into account. 
In making an exclusive design you take a very close look at the person you are designing for, what obstacles does this person have in using a similar design / service. Exclusive design is person specific, a lot of people may have the same disability but the way they cope with is usually unique. This does not mean that what works for this specific person doesn't work for other people, but it doesnt mean it will either. To find out, simply test it! And thats what I'm going to do in this project.

## :speaker: Assignment
In this project we got to work with 'real' person that has a 'real' disability. 
I got to work with Darice and she is deaf. The assignment was to get to know Darice and create a fitting solution for podcasts.
To create an exclusive deisgn, I had to find out how she uses podcast at this moment and how I can improve this experience.


## Darice & Podcasts
As mentioned before, Darice has lost her ability to hear sound. This means that she has experienced sound before but lost it during her lifetime. 
I was suprised that in our meetings our part of the conversation got translated by a typing tolk that transfered our audio speech into text, but Darice was able to respond to that by speaking through her mic. This made testing very smooth and she got all her feedback over to me loud and clear! 
Darice is a frontend-developer and much more than that. Because she is also an expert on accessiblity and exclusive design. She knows all about design principles and this shows in testing with prototypes. In our first meeting my suspicion was confirmed, she doens't listen to podcast but she reads the transcriptions. You might say, ofcourse she does that! But if exclusive design has thought me anything, it is that you always have to verify your thoughs because it might very well be different with this particulair person. Some other points of interest in getting to know Darice was that she has a love for the tv-show 'Friends' and has a very good sense of humor.

## :mag: Testing different solutions
After the kick-off in this project we had about an hour to create a prototype to test with. We devided our group into the people that wanted to work on the closed captions usecase and the ones choose for the podcast usecase. We did a short brainstorm of what our assumptions were and what we wanted to test. We came up with a short list and we each found a topic for a short test. Together we had about 5 small tests in our prototype. In my readme I will be focussing on my progress and sometimes pointing out some interesting testresults from other team members that had an impact on my design progress.

### Test 1: Font & Sizes
My assumption was that she read the podcasts transcriptions and that means alot of text to display.  
To make this typography as good as it could get I wanted to test her preference on font sizes, line hieght and fonts. 
I created a small test enviroment with some dummy podcast text and the possibility to adapt all the font options.
The result of this test was suprising, instead of choosing the best setting possible, she liked to always be able to change these settings.
Because during the day the font could be 22px but when she was tired and for example in bed reading abit before sleeping she might as well be using a bigger font size. Also she mentioned darkmode to be a nice addition as well.

### Test 2: Simulating a podcast

### Test 3: Nuances

## Criteria
Maak verschillende ontwerpen, versies en varianten van je opdracht. Experimenteer met verschillende vormen van interactie en vormgeving. Wat werkt goed? Wat werkt niet goed?
Beschrijf je test-persoon met een User Scenario.
Test je ideeen en ontwerp 3 keer met de test-persoon. Verbeter je ontwerp op basis van de feedback die je hebt gekregen uit de tests. Documenteer de testen goed.
Leg de exclusive design principles uit en beschrijf hoe je die hebt toegepast.
Zorg dat je voor de beoordeling in je Readme (of wiki) een conclusie schrijft waar je in gaat op de leerdoelen en criteria en hoe je dit hebt gehaald. Dit is je bewijsvoering voor het vak.

## Conclusie
Leren hoe je (design) principles in een ontwerp kan toepassen.

User needs begrijpen en gebruiken in je ontwerp.
Leren hoe je moet testen en de resultaten gebruiken voor het verbeteren van je ontwerp.
